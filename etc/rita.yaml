    # These are custom blacklists that you may define. They are lists of either
    # file paths or urls. These custom blacklists are expected to be simple,
    # line separated text documents containing a list of blacklisted entries.

    # Example: CustomIPBlacklists: ["$HOME/.rita/myIPBlacklist.txt"]
    # myIPBlacklist.txt would look like this:
    # 192.168.0.1
    # 10.10.174.1

Beacon:
    # The default minimum number of connections used for beacons analysis.
    # Any two hosts connecting fewer than this number will not be analyzed.
    # 20 was chosen as it is a little bit less than once per hour in a day,
    # and allows for any packet loss that could occur.

    # If you choose a lower value, this will significantly increase both
    # the analysis time and the number of false positives. You can safely
    # increase this value to improve performance if you are not concerned
    # about slow beacons.
    DefaultConnectionThresh: 20

Strobe:
    # This sets the maximum number of connections between any two given hosts that are stored.
    # Connections above this limit will be deleted and not used in other analysis modules. This will
    # also trigger an entry in the strobe module. A lower value will reduce import & analysis time and
    # hide more potential false positives from other modules. A higher value will increase import & 
    # analysis time, increase false positives, but reduce the risk of false negatives.
    # Recommended values for this setting are:
    #    86400 - One connection every second for 24 hours
    #   250000 - (Default) Good middle of the road value
    #   700000 - Safe max value that is unlikely to cause errors
    # The theoretical limit due to implementation limitations is ~1,048,573
    # but in practice timeouts have occurred at lower values.
    ConnectionLimit: 250000
