Filtering:
  # These are filters that affect the import of connection logs. They
  # currently do not apply to dns or http logs.
  # A good reference for networks you may wish to consider is RFC 5735.
  # https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735#section-4

  # Example: AlwaysInclude: ["192.168.1.2/32"]
  # This functionality overrides the NeverInclude and InternalSubnets
  # section, making sure that any connection records containing addresses from
  # this range are kept and not filtered
  AlwaysInclude: []

  # Example: NeverInclude: ["255.255.255.255/32"]
  # This functions as a whitelisting setting, and connections involving
  # ranges entered into this section are filtered out at import time
  NeverInclude:
    - 0.0.0.0/32 # "This" Host           RFC 1122, Section 3.2.1.3
    - 127.0.0.0/8 # Loopback              RFC 1122, Section 3.2.1.3
    - 169.254.0.0/16 # Link Local            RFC 3927
    - 224.0.0.0/4 # Multicast             RFC 3171
    - 255.255.255.255/32 # Limited Broadcast     RFC 919, Section 7
    - ::1/128 # Loopback              RFC 4291, Section 2.5.3

    - ff00::/8 # Multicast             RFC 4291, Section 2.7

  # Example: InternalSubnets: ["10.0.0.0/8","172.16.0.0/12","192.168.0.0/16"]
  # This allows a user to identify their internal network, which will result
  # in any internal to internal and external to external connections being
  # filtered out at import time. Reasonable defaults are provided below
  # but need to be manually verified against each installation before enabling.
  InternalSubnets:
    - 10.0.0.0/8 # Private-Use Networks  RFC 1918
    - 172.16.0.0/12 # Private-Use Networks  RFC 1918
    - 192.168.0.0/16 # Private-Use Networks  RFC 1918
  
  # Example: HTTPProxyServers: ["192.168.0.1"]
  # If the environment uses one or more HTTP proxy servers, list those IP
  # addresses here. In some cases, we can perform additional analysis
  # when internal systems are contacting external systems with
  # a proxy server as an intermediary. The additional processing allows
  # for analyzing the traffic from the internal system to the final destination
  # (e.g., 192.168.0.5 to somedomain.com).
  # Without this processing, we will likely see internal systems beaconing 
  # to the proxy server rather than getting results showing the internal 
  # systems beaconing to an external system. Note that the efficacy
  # of the analysis depends on the proxy server configuration, network
  # topology, and deployment network sensors
  HTTPProxyServers: []
  
  # Example: AlwaysIncludeDomain: ["mydomain.com","*.mydomain.com"]
  # This functionality overrides the NeverIncludeDomain 
  # section, making sure that any connection records containing domains
  # that match this list are kept and not filtered
  # NOTE: When using wildcards, make sure the added entry is in quotes,
  #       ie, '*.mydomain.com'. Only subdomain wildcarding 
  #       (asterisk as the prefix) is supported

Strobe:
  # This sets the maximum number of connections between any two given hosts that are stored.
  # Connections above this limit will be deleted and not used in other analysis modules. This will
  # also trigger an entry in the strobe module. A lower value will reduce import & analysis time and
  # hide more potential false positives from other modules. A higher value will increase import &
  # analysis time, increase false positives, but reduce the risk of false negatives.
  # Recommended values for this setting are:
  #    86400 - One connection every second for 24 hours
  #   250000 - (Default) Good middle of the road value
  #   700000 - Safe max value that is unlikely to cause errors
  # The theoretical limit due to implementation limitations is ~1,048,573
  # but in practice timeouts have occurred at lower values.
