    # Subdirectories of LogPath may be separated into different databases for the
    # test. Map each directory to the database you wish that directory to wind up
    # in. This is good for running tests against multiple subnets and network
    # segments. Put the directory name on the left side of the colon, and the
    # database you wish the logs from that directory to go in on the right side.

    # There needs to be one metadatabase per test. This database holds information
    # about the test and the files related to the test. If there are several
    # subnets mapped in DirectoryMap each will be handled separately and that
    # separation is handled by the metadatabase.

    # If the ingestor is running slowly and there is plenty of resources
    # remaining, it may be wise to increase the number of write threads

    # If MongoDB is tipping over when import is run, then reduce the number of
    # write threads.

    # If use dates is true the logs will be split into databases by date, this is
    # best for if you have multiple days worth of log files in the logpath and wish

    # analysis, and using dates will ensure that tests are broken into 24hour periods
    # around midnight of each day.
