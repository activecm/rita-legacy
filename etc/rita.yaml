Filtering:
  # These are filters that affect the import of connection logs. They

  # A good reference for networks you may wish to consider is RFC 5735.
  # https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735#section-4

  # Example: AlwaysInclude: ["192.168.1.2/32"]
  # This functionality overrides the NeverInclude and InternalSubnets
  # section, making sure that any connection records containing addresses from
  # this range are kept and not filtered
  AlwaysInclude: []

  # Example: NeverInclude: ["255.255.255.255/32"]
  # This functions as a whitelisting setting, and connections involving
  # ranges entered into this section are filtered out at import time
  NeverInclude:
    - 0.0.0.0/32 # "This" Host           RFC 1122, Section 3.2.1.3

  # Example: InternalSubnets: ["10.0.0.0/8","172.16.0.0/12","192.168.0.0/16"]
  # This allows a user to identify their internal network, which will result
  # in any internal to internal and external to external connections being
