### Installation

This guide walks through installing several components.

* [Bro/Zeek](https://www.zeek.org)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [RITA](https://github.com/activecm/rita/)

#### Bro/Zeek

Installing Bro is recommended. RITA needs Bro logs as input so if you already have Bro or its logs you can skip installing Bro.

1. Follow the directions at [https://www.bro.org/sphinx/install/install.html](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/install/install.html).
1. Use Bro's quick start guide to configure [https://www.bro.org/sphinx-git/quickstart/index.html](https://www.bro.org/sphinx-git/quickstart/index.html).

#### MongoDB

RITA requires Mongo for storing and processing data. The current recommended version is 3.6, but anything >= 3.2.0 and < 3.7.0 should work.

1. Follow the MongoDB installation guide at https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
    * Alternatively, this is a direct link to the [download page](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community)
1. Ensure MongoDB is running before running RITA.

#### RITA

You have a few options for installing RITA.
1. The main install script. You can disable Bro and Mongo from being installed with the `--disable-bro` and `--disable-mongo` flags.
1. A prebuilt binary is available for download on [RITA's release page](https://github.com/activecm/rita/releases). In this case you will need to download the config file from the same release and create some directories manually, as described below in the "Configuring the system" section.
1. Compile RITA manually from source. See below.

##### Installing Golang

In order to compile RITA manually you will need to install both [Golang](https://golang.org) and [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).

1. Install Golang using the instructions at [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)
1. After the install you need to create a local Go development environment for your user. This is typically done in `$HOME/go` which is what the directions here will use.
    1. ```mkdir -p $HOME/go/{src,pkg,bin}```
1. Now you must add the `GOPATH` to your .bashrc file. You will also want to add your bin folder to the path for this user.
    1. ```echo 'export GOPATH="$HOME/go"' >> $HOME/.bashrc```
    1. ```echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"' >> $HOME/.bashrc```
    1. ```source $HOME/.bashrc```
1. Install the depenency manager dep using [these instructions](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html)

##### Building RITA

At this point you can build RITA from source code.

1. ```go get github.com/activecm/rita``` or ```git clone git@github.com:activecm/rita.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/activecm/rita```
1. ```cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/activecm/rita```
1. ```make``` (Note that you will need to have `make` installed. You can use your system's package manager to install it.)

This will yield a `rita` binary in the current directory. You can use `make install` to install the binary to `/usr/local/bin/rita` or `PREFIX=/ make install` to install to a different location (`/bin/rita` in this case).

##### Configuring the system

RITA requires a few directories to be created for it to function correctly.

1. ```sudo mkdir /etc/rita && sudo chmod 755 /etc/rita```
1. ```sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/rita/logs && sudo chmod -R 755 /var/lib/rita```

Copy the config file from your local RITA source code.
* ```sudo cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/activecm/rita/etc/rita.yaml /etc/rita/config.yaml && sudo chmod 666 /etc/rita/config.yaml```

At this point, you can modify the config file as needed and test using the ```rita test-config``` command. There will be empty quotes or 0's assigned to empty fields. [RITA's readme](../Readme.md#configuration-file) has more information on changing the configuration.
