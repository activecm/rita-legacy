	// a string of digits or a hex number. Note that hex numbers will begin
	// with the traditional 0x
	Count = "count"

	// INT is a numeric type representing an INT_64 represetned by a string
	// of digits preceded by either a '+' or a '-'. Note that INT may also
	// be expressed in hex and will maintain its leading sign ('-0xff')
	Int = "int"

	// DOUBLE is a numeric type representing a double-precision float.
	// Representation is a string of digits with an optional decimal point
	// as well as optional '+' or '-' proceeding the number. The number may
	// also be optionally scaled with e notation. So 1234 123.4 -123.4
	// +1.234 and .003E-23 are examples of valid double types.

	// TIME is a temporal type representing an absolute time. Until found
	// otherwise it will be assumed that all time values are UNIX-NANO.
	Time = "time"

	// INTERVAL is a temporal type representing relative time. An Interval
	// constant is represented by by a numeric constant followed by a time
	// unit which is one of usec, msec, sec, min, hr, or day. An 's' may
	// be appended to the unit so 3.5 min and 3.5mins represent the same

	Port = "port"

	// ADDR is a type used to represent an IP address. IPv4 addresses are
	// represented in dotted quad notation. IPv6 addresses are written in
	// colon hex notation as outlined in RFC 2373 (including the mixed
	// notation which allows dotted quad IPv4 addresses in the lower 32

	// SUBNET is a type used to represent a subnet in CIDR notation. So
